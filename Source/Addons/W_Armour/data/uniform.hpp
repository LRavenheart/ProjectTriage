/**
* This file is for simple include statements to call the underlying uniform folders in the data folder.
* In the case of the current folder structure, this will be "Infantry", "Aviation" and "Custom"
* Currently, Custom is not being used while the Aux Mod is being reworked.
* Current changes from the old mod are as follows:
* - New paths for Infantry and Aviation MA_Uniforms,
* - Temporary removal of the custom path while the mod is being reworked.
